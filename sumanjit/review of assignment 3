modify the necessary changes as i had mention earlier

for question 2:
review:
--->no need to code for accessing all the boundaries, you can simple do for c32 lable and pur repts befor that.
    if you dont know to put repeats, search once if didn't get idea let me know.
---> in this way also its correct, but no need of this much of implementation.
// or //
----> without using rept just put 4 instrs insteed of 3 in c32 and arrange the offset accordingly ,so that in a single run it will access these all cache lines
 
 
for question 3:
review:
----> code is correct 
----> modify the the div instr with enabling RNE mode.
 
for question 4:
----> not as per the question: interleaved means after every load and store you have to use div instruction(with RNE enable).
----> additional concept you can add is insteed of directly giving floating point values , use floating point register for the conversion of hex(interger values) to floating point.
 
for question 5:
---->modify for the interleaved condtion only ,otherwise its correct.


for question 7:
----> its correct, but try to implement with stack expansion and deletion concept.
