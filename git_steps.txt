SSH-:  git@github.com:soumyaswa/OWN.git

Have made saperate dirs for both:

After git clone :
1. git checkout -b <create your branch>
2. git push -u origin <your branch>
after modifications or work completion:
1.git add <file paths> 
2.git commit -m "message" 
3.git push  // file will be pushed into the remote branch you have created

Note: For branches that exist for a while, it is important that we keep the branch up to date with the mainline by doing routine master merges
1.git fetch
2.git merge origin/main

Merging Changes

Merge branch onto Master
1.git checkout main
2.git pull --rebase
3.git merge origin/<branch name>

Push merged branch
1.git push
